    "The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is one of the longest standing and robust digital humanities projects. Thanks to the longstanding work of the TEI consortium, scholars have extensive tools at their disposal for encoding the nuances of textual data in a systematic way. Once a text has been organized and encoded, it can sometimes be difficult to tell what might come next for your encoded and shared documents. There are number of possibilities related to display and archiving, but let's take a look at the analytical affordances of such structured data.\n",

We have a TEI encoded version of Dostoevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_, [available from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a314)."

    "## Using TEI to Perform More Nuanced Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "TEI can allow us to access more nuanced levels of context in a work than might otherwise be available in NLTK. The code below finds a specific word in an XML document and returns the word within a specified context from within the work. The size of the contextualized result is ultimately up to you, and will change depending on the type of work you are consulting and the XML/TEI schema used. The example text, Homer's Iliad as translated by Alexander Pope [available from Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6130), uses paragraph divisions for the introduction and line divisions for the main text. Our inquiry will be within the main text so the code is written assuming line divisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code performs a similar function to NLTK's concordance feature, in that, both return the word of interest within a contextual window. Like NLTK's text.concordance(), you are able to adjust the size of the window to expand or constrict the character frame around your word of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's NLTK, however, assumes plain text input. This means that although you may change the size of the window, you are limited to framing that window solely out of individual characters. Although you can retrieve all instances of the word of interest within a specified context, you cannot account for the architecture of the text and return the word within its literary home, be that a line, sentence, or paragraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Working with a tagged document allows you to use the document's schema to return a word of interest within its literary environment. If NLTK's concordance function builds its window out of characters, the code below builds its frame through a specified XML tag. The resulting contextual window utilizes the organization of the text, allowing the reader to view the word within a more semantically meaningful environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the results of running NLTK's concordance function for \"Apollo\" on the text, once it has been turned into a state that can be worked by NLTK. Notice that we are unable to distiguish between the introduction and the main text, and that the contextual frame consists solely of a specified number of characters on either side of our word. "

    "The concordance function is useful, but it chops sentences and lines. Depending on the nature of your research, this might make it difficult to get a sense of how Apollo functions within the text, how he is characterized, or the scenes in which he appears. You also might be interested in much larger contexts. By returning a word of interest in a structurally meaningful context, our contextual window is able to better situated our word of interest in a semantically significant environment. The following scipt, then, can be helpful if one wants to leverage the structure of an XML/TEI tagged document in answering research questions more common to \"close reading\" strategies. NLTK measures context by character. In what follows, we use the TEI markup to shift that context to be the line grouping, represented in TEI by the <lg> tag. So if a word of interest occurs in a given line, the script will return a specified number of line groupings on either side of it. We start by reading in the document and processing the TEI."
