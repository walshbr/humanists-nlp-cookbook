    "Very often there is data on the internet that we would just love to use for our purposes as digital humanists. But, perhaps because it is humanities data, the people publishing it online might not have made it available in a format that is very easily used by you. In a perfect world, everyone would make available clearly described dumps of their data in formats that were usable by machines. In reality, a lot of times people just put things on a web page and call it a day. Web scraping refers to the act of using a computer program to pull down the content of a web page (or, often, many web pages). Scraping is very powerful - once you get the hang of it your potential objects of study will be exponentially increased, as you'll no longer be limited to the data that others make available to you. You can start building your own corpora using real-world information. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful realizations that comes with doing this kind of work is that text data is all around us. Anything could be a corpus with enough time and attention. The internet, in particular, offers a wealth of opportunities for aquiring text data if we know how to get at it. This could come in many forms:\n",

    "* Data that exists openly on the internet but that has not been prepared for easy use.\n",
    "* Data that exists openly on the internet and that has been provided in a usable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the former use case. Most often, data on the internet is not presented in a form that is easily accessible. This might be because the author of a particular webpage was not expecting the site to be read and interpreted by anything other than humans, or it might be that the particular form in which the data is presented is not the best form for your purposes. In either case, the ability to extract textual information from a website can be quite powerful.\n",

GitHub also offers a [raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walshbr/humanists-nlp-cookbook/master/scraping-corpus/dickinson/xi.txt) for each of these files that is separate from the viewing interface.

    "Scraping sources through a script like this can raise a lot of questions. Do the people allow you to do so? Some websites explicitly detail whether or not you can in their terms of service. Project Gutenberg, for example, explicitly tells you that you *cannot* scrape their website. Doing so anyway potentially opens you to legal repercussions. Even if a site does not explicitly forbid scraping, it can still feel ethically suspect. A recent example of this is when a research scraping all publically available OKCupid user data. While it is true that these users made their personal information publicly available, they probably did not intend that their lives be exposed to this level of scrutiny. When getting ready to scrape data, it's usually a good idea to ask a series of questions:\n",
    "* Was this data meant to be public?\n",
    "* Am I harming anyone by pulling down this data?\n",
    "* Is this data associated with anyone's identity in a way that they might object to?\n",

    "* Can I get the data in some other way?\n",
    "* Is my scraping going to harm the website in some way?\n",

    "Related to this last point - even if all these questions seem to be fine, you still need to be careful. Scraping a website can very often look like a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). If you, say, try to scrape 10,000 links from Project Gutenberg, those 10,000 hits on Project Gutenberg's site could cause issues for their system. To get around this, it's often good practice to purposely slow down your scraper so that it more closely mimics the behavior of a human user. Rather than scraping multiple links per second, the following snippet tells the scraper to rest a random interval of up to 6 seconds between downloads:"
