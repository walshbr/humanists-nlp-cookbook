    "One of the powerful realizations that comes with doing this kind of work is that text data is all around us. Very often there is data on the internet that we would just love to use for our purposes as digital humanists. In a perfect world, everyone would make available clearly described dumps of their data in formats that were usable by machines. In reality, often people just put things on a web page and call it a day. Most often, data on the internet is not presented in a form that is easily accessible.\n",

    "Web scraping refers to the act of using a computer program to pull down the content of a web page (or, often, many web pages). Scraping is very powerful, and it can often be the first step in a pipeline that takes information from the web and prepares it for use in NLP. Once you get the hang of scraping, a range of new objects of study will become accessible to you. You'll no longer be limited to the data that others make available to you. You can start building your own corpora using real-world information. \n",

The poem is there, but it is embedded in a viewing interface designed by GitHub. And the complicated set of scraping we did involving the 'tr' tags was meant to get rid of that interface and pull out just the poem. GitHub also offers a [raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walshbr/humanists-nlp-cookbook/master/scraping-corpus/dickinson/xi.txt) for each of these files that is separate from the viewing interface. We could have scraped that directly for cleaner results. In order to do so we would have had to manipulate our URLS to change this\n",

    "\n",
    "So this was a slightly complicated example to use, but it still works. When deciding whether or not scraping is an option, at its core, you are looking for a site that has a repeated structure across all its pages. You can ask a short set of questions of a page to determine if scraping is an option:\n",
    "\n",
    "* are all the links to the pages you're interested in present on a single page?\n",
    "* are all the pages you're interested in, instead, represented on a series of pages?\n",

    "In general, sites in these forms are the easiest to pull data from, because you can easily imagine constructing the URLs, collecting them, and harvesting them. If you need, say, to input a search query into a form on the page to get the results you would want to scrape the process gets much more complicated if not impossible. "

    "Scraping sources through a script like this can raise a lot of questions. Do the people allow you to do so? Some websites explicitly detail whether or not you can scrape in their terms of service. Project Gutenberg, for example, explicitly tells you that you *cannot* scrape their website. Doing so anyway potentially opens you to legal repercussions. Even if a site does not explicitly forbid scraping, it can still feel ethically suspect to do so. A recent example of this is when a researcher scraped all publically available OKCupid user data and made it available online. The mere presence of the data online does not mean it was meant to be used for scraping. When getting ready to scrape data, it's usually a good idea to ask a series of questions:\n",
    "* Was this data meant to be public?\n",
    "* Am I harming anyone by pulling down this data?\n",
    "* Is this data associated with anyone's identity in a way that they might object to?\n",

Even if scraping is allowed, doing so rapidly can very often look like a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). If you, say, try to scrape 10,000 links a single site, those 10,000 hits on could cause issues for their system. To get around this, it's often good practice to purposely slow down your scraper so that it more closely mimics the interactions of a human user. Rather than scraping multiple links per second, the following snippet tells the scraper to rest a random interval of up to 6 seconds between downloads:"

    "If you're concerned it is usually a good idea to contact the people whose site you want to work with to ask if they mind you scraping their work.

And if you work at an institution with an IRB panel, they can probably help you make determinations about whether the data involved with your work is sensitive if it involves human subejcts. It's better to approach these questions intentionally and with care."
